A Windows desktop wallpaper changer/manager
This program downloads images from 'Windows Spotlight' and shows them as wallpapers.
It can change the image from time to time (programmable interval).
It controls the screen background brigtness when there is any mouse movement so that
you can have very bright pictures on your screen without disturbing the visualization
of icons and their identifications on the Windows Desktop.
It can also provide a "background noise" to calm you down at times....
